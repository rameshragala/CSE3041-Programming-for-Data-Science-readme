1. print the alphabets with corresponding index, where a is started with 1.

2. Create series1 with alphabets in uppercase and series2 with alpahbets in lowercase. combine these two series such as first column in series have alphabets in uppercase and second column have alphabets in lowecase. It also has index from 1 to 26 for both columns.
